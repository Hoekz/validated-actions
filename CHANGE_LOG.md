# v1.1

The validation failed action will now be sent throught the entire middleware chain instead of just the middleware that come after `createValidateActionsMiddleware`

# v1.x

This is the start to the project as a useable and supported package. This package has two main exports `makeValidatable`, and `createValidateActionsMiddleware`. For usages you can reference the README.md for 1.x

# < v0.x

It is encourage that you do not use versions of this software prior to v1.x.
